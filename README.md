# initials_CS50
simple C code to prompt for name and then give user initials.

Takes first letter of string and then looks for any spaces and takes the next letter after the space. It also checks if they are lower case and will change the letters to upper case if nessessary. 

Does not take into account names with hyphens in at the moment.
